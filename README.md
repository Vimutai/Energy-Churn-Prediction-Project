# ⚡ Energy Company Data Cleaning & Exploration

**Project Type:** Data Cleaning + Exploratory Analysis  
**Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib  

## 🔍 Overview

This project involves preparing and analyzing a fictional energy company's customer dataset. It was completed as part of my personal data cleaning and analysis practice for my portfolio.

Tasks completed:
- Imported and explored raw energy usage and price data
- Cleaned missing values and formatted inconsistent types
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency
- Merged relevant data files (`energy.raw.csv` & `energy.price.csv`)
- Created summary statistics and visualized trends (e.g., usage vs. price)

## 📁 Files in this Folder
- `energy.raw.csv` – The original, uncleaned dataset  
- `energy.cleaned.csv` – Final cleaned version ready for analysis or modeling  
- `energy_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all cleaning, processing, and basic charts  
- `README.md` – This file  

## ✅ Outcome

- Produced a clean, structured dataset  
- Identified patterns in energy usage and pricing  
- Created visual summaries for business insights
