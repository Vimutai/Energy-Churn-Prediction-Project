# ⚡ Energy Company Data Cleaning, Exploration & Churn Prediction

**Project Type:** Data Cleaning · Exploratory Data Analysis · Predictive Modeling  
**Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib  

## 🔍 Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario involving an energy company’s customer dataset. It covers the full data lifecycle — from cleaning and exploration to building a churn prediction model. The project demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, insight extraction, and machine learning using Python.

## 🧹 Key Tasks Performed

- Cleaned raw energy usage and pricing data
- Standardized and renamed columns for consistency
- Handled missing values and formatted incorrect types
- Explored data visually to identify trends (e.g., usage vs. price)
- Built a **Random Forest** classifier to predict customer churn
- Evaluated model performance and generated business-friendly insights

## 📁 Files Included

- `energy-predion-raw.csv` – Raw input dataset *(optional: rename to fix typo → `energy-prediction-raw.csv`)*  
- `energy.cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset prepared for modeling  
- `prediction.ipynb` – Notebook for cleaning and early exploration  
- `data-modeling.ipynb` – Model training, evaluation, and prediction logic  
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## ✅ Project Outcomes

- Produced a structured and ready-to-use dataset for analysis  
- Discovered trends in customer behavior and pricing  
- Trained a **Random Forest model** with ~85% accuracy on churn prediction  
- Delivered insight-driven recommendations for reducing churn
